# **Motivation to became a developer**
### Well my motivation is simple really, I was always fascinated with programming and anything that is computer related. To create something like a programm that does something you want it to do, is very entertaining and interesting to the point that you want to dedicate your life to it. To be honest, I loved playing video games and that got me into computers and programming in general.

## My favourite technology is blockchain. *Blockchain* is very interesting and important right now. Crypto is the future, and blockchain is providing an important metod which doesn't need and seperate entity for supervises transactions.
# Conclusion about Git versioning system
### Versioning systems are systems that help developers return to the previus version of a file if they encounter an error. This is very practical, because it can help you see who made an error and when it happened. Developers usually resolve this issue with a simple method, they save a different versions of a file in a different directories with a time stamp. One of the version systems is Gitkraken, and it is very practical and user friendly.
