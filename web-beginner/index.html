        <h2 class="the-game-heading">The game</h2>
        <p>
            Assassin's Creed is an open-world, action-adventure, and stealth game franchise published by Ubisoft and developed mainly by its studio Ubisoft Montreal using the game engine Anvil and its more advanced derivatives.
            Created by Patrice Désilets, Jade Raymond, and Corey May, the Assassin's Creed video game series depicts a fictional millennia-old struggle between the Order of Assassins, who fight for peace and free will, and the Knights Templar, who desire peace through order and control. The series features historical fiction, science fiction, and fictional characters intertwined with real-world historical events and historical figures.
            The first Assassin's Creed was released in 2007, and it has featured twelve main games in total, the most recent being Assassin's Creed Valhalla in 2020. Main games in the Assassin's Creed series are set in an open world and played from the third-person view. Gameplay revolves around combat, stealth, and exploration, including the use of parkour to navigate the environment. The games feature both main and side missions, and some titles also include competitive and cooperative multiplayer game modes.
        </p>
        <h2 class="dev-headin">The development of the game</h2>
        <p>
            While the games in the series have had several narrative arcs, Ubisoft views the series as currently having three periods of development and design philosophy. Phase one, covering up to Assassin's Creed Syndicate, featured games structured around single-player content, and while centering on open world spaces and several role-playing elements, were more action-adventure and stealth-oriented. Period two, covering from Assassin's Creed Origins to Assassin's Creed Mirage, brought in more role-playing elements and live-service features to increase player engagement. Period three will launch with Assassin's Creed: Red, using lessons from the second period of development to make engrossing single-player games similar to the original titles but with features to allow players to share achievements and content with others, all to be backed by the Infinity hub system.
            A series of art books, encyclopedias, comics, novelizations, and novels have been also been published. A live-action film adaptation of the series, titled Assassin's Creed, was released in 2016.
        </p>
        <h2 class="film-heading">Film</h2>
        <p>
            A live-action film, Assassin's Creed, set in the same universe as the video games and other media, was released on December 21, 2016. Development for the film began in October 2011, when Sony Pictures entered final negotiations with Ubisoft Motion Pictures to make the film. In July 2012, Michael Fassbender was announced to star in the film, as well as co-produce the film. His role was revealed in August 2015 as Callum Lynch, whose ancestor Aguilar, is an Assassin from 15th-century Spain. In October 2012, Ubisoft revealed the film would no longer be produced by Sony Pictures, instead co-produced with New Regency and distributed by 20th Century Fox. In January 2013, Michael Lesslie was hired to write the film, with Scott Frank, Adam Cooper and Bill Collage performing rewrites to the script. By the end of April 2014, Justin Kurzel was in talks to direct. Principal photography began on August 31, 2015, and ended on January 15, 2016. The film was poorly received by critics and performed poorly at the box office, losing an estimated $75 to $100 million and becoming one of the biggest box office bombs of 2016.  
            Ascendance is an animated short by UbiWorkshop and Ubisoft Montreal, which bridges the gap between Assassin's Creed II and Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood.
            Set during the events of Brotherhood, it shows Ezio meeting with a hooded man (revealed at the end of the film to be Leonardo da Vinci) to gather information about Cesare Borgia. Most of the film revolves around Cesare's backstory and rise to power in Italy, as narrated by Leonardo to Ezio. The animated short was revealed by UbiWorkshop on November 10, 2010.
            It was released on November 16, 2010, for Xbox Live, PlayStation Store and iTunes Store.

        <h2 class="gameplay-heading">Gameplay</h2>
        <p>
            The Assassin's Creed games are centered around one or more fictional members of the Order of the Assassins. Their memories are experienced by an in-game character in the modern-day period through a device called the Animus and its derivations. The Animus allows the user to explore these memories passed down via genetics. Within the context of the game, this provides a diegetic interface to the real-world player of the game, showing them elements like health bars, a mini-map, and target objectives as if presented by the Animus. Additionally, should the player cause the historical character to die or fail a mission, this is rectified as desynchronization of the genetic memory, allowing the player to try the mission again. Through the Animus interface, the player can retry any past mission already completed; for example, in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, the player achieves better synchronization results by performing the mission in a specific manner, such as by only killing the mission's target. The Animus also imparts special abilities to the modern-day character that helps them to see their target in a crowd or other unique points of interest.
            While playing as the Assassin characters, the games are generally presented from a third-person view in an open world environment, focusing on stealth and parkour. The games use a mission structure to follow the main story, assigning the player to complete an assassination of public figureheads or a covert mission. Alternatively, several side missions are available, such as mapping out the expansive cities from a high perch followed by performing a leap of faith into a haystack below, collecting treasures hidden across the cities, exploring ruins for relics, building a brotherhood of assassins to perform other tasks, or funding the rebuilding of a city through purchasing and upgrading of shops and other features. At times, the player is in direct control of the modern-day character who, by nature of the Animus use, has learned Assassin techniques through the bleeding effect, as well as their genetic ability of Eagle Vision, which separates friend, foe, and assassination targets by illuminating people in different colors.
            The games use the concept of active versus passive moves, with active moves, such as running, climbing the sides of buildings, or jumping between rooftops, more likely to alert the attention of nearby guards. When the guards become alerted, the player must either fight them or break their line of sight and locate a hiding place, such as a haystack or a well, and wait until the guards' alert is reduced. The combat system allows for a number of unique weapons, armor, and moves, including the use of a hidden blade set in a bracer on the Assassin's arm, which can be used to perform surreptitious assassinations.

        <h2 class="Story-heading">Storyline</h2>
        <p>
            The Assassin's Creed games primarily revolve around the rivalry and conflict between two ancient secret societies: the Order of Assassins, who represents freedom, and the Knights Templar, who represents order. Versions of these societies have existed for centuries, with the Assassins seeking to stop the Templars from gaining control of Pieces of Eden, artifacts that can override free will to control people.[19]
            These artifacts are remnants of an ancient species pre-dating humanity called the Isu, or Precursors, which created humanity to live in peace alongside them. The Isu ensured humans could not rise against them by creating the Pieces of Eden to control them. When the first hybrid Isu-human beings emerged, named Adam and Eve, they were immune to the effects of the Pieces of Eden. They stole the Pieces of Eden, which led to a great war that ended when a massive solar flare devastated the surface of the Earth. The Isu began to die out while humanity thrived. Three Isu—Minerva, Juno, and Jupiter—attempted to prepare humanity for a solar flare they knew would come centuries later. Minerva and Jupiter prepared vaults from which humanity could activate a protective shield around Earth with the Pieces of Eden and the Eye, a means to communicate how to find and use these vaults; however, Juno saw humanity as a threat and attempted to sabotage Minerva and Jupiter's plan. Minerva and Jupiter were forced to destroy Juno, unaware she had hidden her consciousness to wake upon activation of the Eye. All that remained of the Isu were the traces of their memories in the world's mythologies, and religions, while the Pieces of Eden were lost to time.[19]
            The series takes place in the modern era, in which the Templars have established the mega-corporation Abstergo Industries. Abstergo has developed a device, the Animus, whose user can relive the memories of their ancestors through their genetic material. Abstergo has kidnapped people who are descendants of past Assassins to locate the missing Pieces of Eden via the Animus.[19] A user of the Animus can move about in simulated memories as their ancestor, but performing actions outside the bounds of what their ancestor did can lead to desynchronization of the memory.[14][15] Extended use of the Animus creates a bleeding effect that gives users some of the skills and capabilities they experienced with their ancestor.
        </p>
        <h2 class="brotherhood-heading">Brotherhood</h2>
        <p>
            The game introduces the titular Brotherhood system, which allows the player, as Ezio, to recruit new Assassin initiates after destroying any of twelve "Borgia towers" around Rome where papal troops are stationed, and then rescuing disgruntled citizens from being harassed by city guards. The player can then send these Assassin recruits to assignments around Europe or call them for support during missions (if they are not already occupied). Tasking the novice Assassins makes them gain experience, and the player can customize their appearance, skills, and weapon training to some degree by spending the skill points they have earned. Assassins can die on missions, from which they will not return.
            In Brotherhood, Ezio gets to master several new gadgets, including Leonardo da Vinci's parachute, which can be used when jumping from tall buildings,[4] as well as poison darts, a faster acting poison, and a crossbow. A series of side missions given by Leonardo allow the player to briefly use his war machines, such as a cannon-equipped Great Kite and a prototype tank, which he was forced to design for the Templars; Ezio must destroy these machines and their designs before more can be created. Other side missions include assassinating Templar agents in Rome, completing challenges for the three ally factions in the game (Courtesans, Thieves, and Mercenaries), and exploring underground locations to find the keys to the treasure of the Followers of Romulus—a secret cult who worship Romulus, the legendary founder of Rome. After reaching certain levels of synchronization, the player can also relive several repressed memories of Ezio's past lover, Cristina Vespucci.
            The primary setting of the game is Rome, which has fallen into ruin due to the corrupt rule of the Borgia papacy and the Templars, who have concentrated all the wealth in the Vatican. Similarly to Monteriggioni in Assassin's Creed II, the player can invest in the city, witness its development, and unlock rewards.
            Unlike previous installments, travel between different cities or regions is no longer present, as most of the action take place around Rome. Instead, a series of tunnel networks throughout the city allows the player to travel to the different districts. However, certain main and side missions take the player to various locations outside of Rome, including the harbor of Naples; the Alban Hills (Colli Albani); and part of Navarre, Spain, among others.
            Horses play a larger role in Brotherhood, not only used as a means of transport (inside the city for the first time) but as a component of acrobatic sequences and advanced combat as well, allowing ranged weapons to be used while riding them. The game also features various types of horse-related assassinations, such as horse-to-horse assassinations. To facilitate traversal, Brotherhood introduces merchandise lifts, which can be used to quickly climb up high buildings or structures.

            Ezio's story continues in December 1499, as he exits the Vault and escapes Rome with his uncle, Mario (Fred Tatasciore). Returning to Monteriggioni, Ezio explains to his fellow Assassins what he saw inside the Vault and is comforted by the prospect that his personal vendetta is over; however, Niccolò Machiavelli (Shawn Baichoo) challenges Ezio's decision to leave Rodrigo Borgia (Manuel Tadros) alive. The following day, Monteriggioni is besieged by the Papal Army, commanded by Cesare Borgia (Andreas Apergis), Rodrigo's son. Cesare kills Mario and claims the Apple for the Templars. An injured Ezio escapes and travels to Rome, the center of Templar power in Italy, seeking vengeance against the Borgias. There, he discovers that the Assassin Order had lost much of its manpower and strength. Determined to rebuild the Guild, Ezio convinces Machiavelli that he can lead it, recruiting people for the Brotherhood and restoring it to its former strength.
            After learning of Ezio's actions, Cesare confronts his father to ask for more money and the Apple. Rodrigo refuses, cautious of provoking the Assassins, and attempts to poison his son, fearing Cesare's lust for power. Cesare, having taken an antidote beforehand, survives and murders Rodrigo. After learning of the Apple's location, Ezio retrieves it from within St. Peter's Basilica, before using it to overwhelm Cesare's forces and withdraw the backing of his supporters. Cesare is arrested by Pope Julius II's Papal Army after Ezio and the Assassins confront him and kill his remaining followers.
            Using the coordinates from Ezio's memories, Desmond, Lucy, Shaun, and Rebecca travel to the Temple where Ezio hid the Apple, intending to use it to locate other Temples and keep the Pieces of Eden they contain out of the Templars' reach. As Desmond enters the Temple, he is confronted with holographic apparitions of a woman called Juno (Nadia Verrucci), similar to Minerva. She comments on humanity's lack of knowledge, calling it "innocent and ignorant", before suddenly becoming angry and yelling, "We should have left you as you were!" As Desmond approaches the Apple and touches it, time freezes around him. Juno states that Desmond is descended from her race, and is their enemy; she also says there is a woman who would accompany him through "the gate," but must not be allowed to. She takes control of Desmond's body and forces him to stab Lucy. Both fall to the ground, with Lucy dead and Desmond entering a coma. As the credits roll, two men are heard discussing whether to put Desmond back in the Animus.

        <h2 class="review-heading">Review</h2>
        <p>
            Assassin's Creed II is definitely one of my favourite games of the last 12 months. It was a meaty gaming meal that took several steps towards fulfilling the promise of the original, with new mechanics, more variety in gameplay, and an alluring new setting: renaissance Italy. It was a big leap, in other words: a worthy sequel in all regards.
            Brotherhood, on the other hand, will have a slightly harder time proving its worth. Rather than moving to a new time period, it continues directly on from the events of Assassin's Creed II, only with the action shifting almost entirely to Rome. Like previous titles, there's also a modern-day component. The game is once again framed by the on-going battle between the Templars and Assassins, and players are actually assuming the role of Desmond, who lives in the present day and is able to experience the memories of his ancestor Ezio using a device called the animus. The game cuts between the two time periods but the bulk of the gameplay occurs in renaissance Rome.
            Brotherhood is a great game, but it's hard to wholeheartedly recommend. This is really a title designed for fans of Assassin's Creed II, as it's a continuation of that story, but the reality is that people who finished that game want something new - or that at least represents a clear step forward. Brotherhood doesn't deliver that. The game doesn't advance the wider narrative very far, the new mechanics don't really add a great deal and the mission designs rarely explore new gameplay possibilities.
            That said, Brotherhood really looks the part, with a step up in the graphics department - particularly on PS3, and a massive and varied city to explore. It also introduces an innovative multiplayer suite, for which the team(s) should be applauded. At the end of the day, it depends what you're looking for. If you're new to Assassin's Creed, this is a solid entry, but picking up the threads of the convoluted story may be a challenge. If you're an experienced assassin, on the other hand, expect to tread pretty similar ground to the last title.

        <h2 class="fun-facts-heading">Fun facts</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The franchise started by accident</li>
            <p>
                While Assassin's Creed is a household name today, it almost ended up as something very different. As DidYouKnowGaming? reveals, the original crusade-era set game was due to a Prince of Persia game known as Prince of Persia: Assassin, with a prince's bodyguard as the protagonist. Ubisoft top brass, unhappy with the idea of a Prince of Persia game not being about a prince (oddly, Nintendo don't see an issue with when it comes to Zelda), insisted on a new brand, and Assassin's Creed was born.
            </p>
            <li>The game's back story streches 2.500 years</li>
            <p>
                While the story of the mainline games stretches around 821 years, from the original Assassin's Creed in 1191 to around 2012 and Desmond Miles' modern day story, Ubisoft has created a massive, Star Wars Expanded Universe style backstory stuffed with lore and interspliced with historical events. According to the publisher, the first known assassin was Xerxes, who killed King Darius of Persia according to the ancient Greek historian Herodotus, meaning the tradition stretches back millenia.  
            </p>
            <li>The series has spawned 10 novels</li>
            <p>
                As well as a host of spin-off comics, Assassin's Creed has spawned a long-running series of novels set in the game universe. Eight were written by English historian Anton Gill under the pen name Oliver Bowden, while the second of two young-adult-focused novels, Assassin's Creed: Last Descendants is due for release in January.
            </p>
            <li>Ezio can assassinate fighting-game characters</li>
            <p>
                As well as the premeditated murder of many historical figures - including a Catholic Pope - Ezio Auditore is also responsible for the deaths of some of Bandai Namco's most famous fictional characters. Repeatedly. That's because the dashing assassin has also appeared in a beat'em up, fighting it out with the stars of one of the Japanese publisher's most popular series in Soulcalibur V for PS3 and Xbox 360.
